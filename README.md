MatLab code for the Simplex Zen paper

The main graphs for all mechanisms (Shepard plots, and Kruskal, Spearman Rho, Sammon and
Quadratic Loss for diminishing dimensions) are found in the "main tests" folder. Just set the
data set id and run... which will work for generated data sets, but for the others you'll need to
import the data and write code to read it into MatLab arrays.

For ANN SIFT that's already there (fvecs_read in "data sets", for the others it's up to you how
you extract and store the data, but it should be fairly straightforward.

Of course feel free to contact me if you need help with that...!
